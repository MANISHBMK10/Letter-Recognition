# Letter-Recognition
In this Project, 20000 unique stimuli were taken and, we trained 16000 items and tested remaining 4000 items through 5 different Classifications.
The letter recognition has been one of the most popular research
Area in pattern recognition in recent years . It is a task which uses
Artificial intelligence to identify the letters . It is a task which
requires a complex hypothesis to increase the accuracy ,precision
and efficiency. We plotted confusion matrix of different types of
Classifications like Gaussian , Decision Tree , SVM , KNN , MLP for 20000 unique stimuli and compared accuracy.
